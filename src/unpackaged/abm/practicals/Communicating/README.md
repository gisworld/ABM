Practical reads in a CSV file to create the environment <br>
Agents eat the environment and are sick after 100 units<br>
The agents can share (halve) their resources with neighbouring agents<br>
The new environment file is written out to a file<br>
The current stores of the sheep at the end of the model are appended to another text file<br>
The results are shown on a scatter plot<br>
## model_argv.py
This instance of the model allows users to enter variables via the command line<br>
run as python model_argv.py num_of_agents Num_of_iterations Neighbourhood
