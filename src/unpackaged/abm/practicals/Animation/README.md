## Sheep folder
- model.py files allows for 100 iterations
- model_stopping_condition_argv.py files allow the user to input values in command line in the following format: Num_of_agents, Num_of_iterations, Neighbourhood
- model_stopping_condition.py files have a built in stop when sheep are half full
## Wolves eat sheep
- model.py files allows for 100 iterations
- model_stopping_condition_argv.py files allow the user to input values in command line in the following format: Num_of_agents, Num_of_wolves, Num_of_iterations, Neighbourhood
- model_stopping_condition.py files have a built in stop when sheep are all eaten or 200 iterations are reached
## Trying Tkinter
- An optional practical using tkinter as a UI to run the model from a drop down menu
